# Customer-Segmentation-and-Anomaly-Detection-Using-Clustering-PCA


This project demonstrates customer segmentation and anomaly detection on credit card data using unsupervised machine learning techniques. It employs various clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture, Hierarchical Clustering) combined with PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualisation, and uses anomaly detection models to identify outlier behaviours.

Overview

Objective:
Segment customers based on transaction data and identify potential anomalies for further analysis.
Techniques:
Data Preprocessing (Log Transformation, Feature Scaling)
Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture, Agglomerative Clustering)
Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor)
Visualisation (Count Plots, Scatter Plots, Pairplots)
Dataset:
CC GENERAL.csv â€“ A dataset containing credit card customer information.
